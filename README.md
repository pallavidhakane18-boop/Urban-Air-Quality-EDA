# 🌆 Urban Air Quality EDA (India) — Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis  
### A Complete Python-Based Project on Real-World Air Pollution Data

This project performs **end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Indian air-quality datasets using advanced data cleaning, feature engineering, time-series insights, clustering, and anomaly detection.

It is designed as a **full professional portfolio project** for Data Analyst & Data Scientist roles.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- ✔ Cleaned & processed raw air-quality data  
- ✔ Created advanced features:  
  - Rolling averages (7-day & 30-day AQI trends)  
  - PM2.5/PM10 ratio  
  - Custom **City Health Index**  
- ✔ Conducted Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate EDA  
- ✔ Time-Series trend analysis (daily, monthly, weekend patterns)  
- ✔ Built **correlation heatmaps**, scatter plots, histograms & pairplots  
- ✔ Performed **K-Means Clustering** → grouped cities by pollution behavior  
- ✔ Performed **Anomaly Detection** using z-score  
- ✔ Exported insights, charts, and clean datasets for ML or reporting

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains:

- **city_day.csv** — daily AQI & pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3)  
- **city_hour.csv** — hourly pollutant measurements  
- **stations.csv** — station metadata (City, Station, State)  

Source: Kaggle  
Data Range: Multi-year daily & hourly AQI values for major Indian cities.
